# NewsAgent

It’s a comprehensive news website powered by the News API and hosted on Firebase. NewsAgent provides
users with up-to-date news articles categorized into Business, Entertainment, Health, Science, Sports, and
Technology sections. This project demonstrates my proficiency in web development, data integration, and
user-focused content delivery.
